This folder contains the main wave do file folders as well as "MWI Panel Assembly.do", which produces mwi_panel_ids.dta (also provided; it is not necessary to run the do file yourself). The purpose of this file is to provide harmonized household IDs so that "split-off" households can be tracked through the panel sample and is used to automatically generate a panel-harmonized dataset at the beginning of each wave do file.
