# Malawi IHS-IHPS Wave 3 (2016-2017)
CODING STATUS:Work in Progress

## Prerequisites
* Download the raw data from https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3557
* Extract the files to the "Raw DTA Files" folder in the cloned directory
* Update the paths on lines 173-176 with the correct paths to the raw data and output files.

## Table of Contents
### Globals
* This section sets global variables for use later in the script, including:
  * Population
    * Malawi_IHS_LSMS_ISA_W3_pop_tot - Total population in 2017 (World Bank)
    * Malawi_IHS_LSMS_ISA_W3_pop_rur - Rural population in 2017 (World Bank)
    * Malawi_IHS_LSMS_ISA_W3_pop_rur - Urban population in 2017 (World Bank)
  * Non-GPS-Plots
    * drop_unmeas_plots - if not 0, this global will remove any plot that is not measured by GPS from the sample. Used to reduce variability in yields that results from uncertainty around farmer area estimation and nonstandard unit conversion
  * Exchange Rates
    * IHS_LSMS_ISA_W3_exchange_rate - USD-Kwacha conversion
    * IHS_LSMS_ISA_W3_gdp_ppp_dollar - GDP-based purchasing power parity conversion, World Bank Indicator PA.NUS.PPP
    * IHS_LSMS_ISA_W3_cons_ppp_dollar - Private-consumption-based purchasing power parity conversion, World Bank Indicator PA.NUS.PRVT.P
    * IHS_LSMS_ISA_W3_inflation - Ratio of 2017:2016 Malawi consumer price index (World Bank), used for calculating poverty thresholds
 
### Winsorization Thresholds
* We correct outliers by Winsorization - setting values above the 99th and/or below the 1st percentiles to the value of the 99th or 1st percentile. The thresholds can be adjusted here or removed by setting them to 0 and 100
    * wins_lower_thres 1-Threshold for winzorization at the bottom of the distribution of continous variables
    * wins_upper_thres 99-Threshold for winzorization at the top of the distribution of continous variables	
					
### Globals of Priority Crops
* This section defines the list of crops used to report crop-specific indicators, including indicators for monocropped plots. Adjust this list to change the output.

### Appending Malawi IHPS and IHS Data 
* IHS3 is an expansion of IHS2. A sub-sample of IHS3 EAs were surveyed twice reduce recall associated with different aspects of agricultural data collection and track and resurvey these households in 2013 as part of the Integrated Household Panel Survey 2013 (IHPS; microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2248). Therefore, we append the panel and cross-sectional data to ensure we're working with a complete data from both panel and crossectional surveys.
* All the modules starting from Plot Areas use appended data. To run the append code for the first time:  
	* Created a "Temp" folder in "Final DTA Files" folders  
	* Commented out macro which creates "created_data" in the globals directory   
	* Created a new appended paths in the code    
 	* After running the append code, changed created_data file path back to raw/created_data in the globals directory

`MWI_IHS_IHPS_W3_hh_cost_inputs_long_complete.dta`  
**Coding Status:**  
In progress (Incomplete)  
**Known Issues:**
	* LABOR: Labor expense estimates are severely understated for several reasons: 1. the survey instrument did not ask for number of hired labors. Therefore, the constructed value of hired labor for some households could represent all hired labor costs or per laborer hired labor costs. 2. We typically use the value of hired labor to imput the value of family and nonhired (exchange) labor. However, due to issues with how hired labor is contructed, we cannot use these values to impute the value of family or nonhired (exchange) labor.
	* PLOT RENTS: Some rainy season data is missing. The final output on plot rents has too few of observations as compared to reported plot rents in the raw data.
	* TRANSPORTATION COSTS: The survey instrument collects information on transportation costs associated with bringing crops to market (seperate from transportation costs associated with picking up seed and other inputs which we currently are reporting). We are still in the process of building this smaller module and incorporating into crop expenses. Crop expenses in aggregate will be understated for now because transportation costs for crops are missing.

### Monocropped Plots
