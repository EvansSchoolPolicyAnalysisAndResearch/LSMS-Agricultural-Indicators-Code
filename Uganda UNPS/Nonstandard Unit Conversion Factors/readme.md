This folder has the harmonized nonstandard unit conversion factors files. In the raw data, conversion factors for nonstandard units of measure for crops are reported on a per-observation basis, and so the implied per-kg conversion factor can vary substantially within the same crop and unit. We take regional medians across all 7 waves and use them to standardize the unit conversion. However, given the "true" conversion factor is unknown for each observation, the total reported harvests should be assumed to have high uncertainty.
