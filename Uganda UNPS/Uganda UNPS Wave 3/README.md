# README File - Uganda NPS Wave 3 (2011-2012)

## PREREQUESITES
Link to download data from the World Bank: https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2059 
Dta Files downloaded must be compiled in a raw folder -  global UGS_W3_raw_data in the Master Do-file. Also, you need to create a temporary folder where datasets that have been processed -  cleaned, curated and/or transformed -, and a final folder where final indicators are summarized at different units of analysis (e.g., household, individual, plot level).
Addiotionaly, in the temporary file you need to save the following datasets that can be found in (???):
1. UG_Conv_fact_sold_table_update.dta
2. UG_Conv_fact_sold_table_national_update.dta
3. UG_Conv_fact_harvest_table_update.dta
4. UG_Conv_fact_harvest_table_national_update.dta

The datasets above include the median conversion factors for both Crop harvested and Sold for each unit code (e.g., Sacks, Tin, Basket, Jerrican, etc.) at the regional and national level calculated using all Uganda NPS Waves available. These Standard Conversion factor tables are used in the All plots and Gross Crop Revenue sections to calculate Kilograms harvested, prices per kilogram, and value of crop harvested.

### ALL PLOTS
- **DESCRIPTION:** This section uses the Price per Kilogram Methodology explained below. 
By converting quantities sold to kilograms, crops are comparable across distinct units, increasing the number of observations to calculate prices per kg for each geographic location. From a methodological standpoint, it may also be a good idea to convert to kilograms first because kilogram conversions are ostensible to kg dried/shelled crop, so we can avoid issues related to the fact that we have condition harvested but not condition sold.
It requires the use of Crop conversion factors sold/harvested indicators which might have measurement errors and uncertainty. These conversion factors are not consistent for the same crop-condition-unit or crop-condition-unit-region. To solve these inconsistencies, we have created a Standard Conversion factor (CF) table that calculated the median CF -for both sold and harvested - for each crop-unit-region using all 7 Uganda LSMS-ISA waves available. Below, you can find each step to calculate the final indicators in this section. 
1.	[standard Quantity Sold (kg)]: Convert every crop sold in quantity units into kilograms (Quantity sold kg) using the Standard Sold Conversion factor table – which calculates the median conversion factor sold for at the crop-unit regional level using all Uganda waves available.
2.	 [Standard Price per kg]: Calculate the Standard Price per kg (Sold Value $/Qty Sold (kg)) using the Total value sold ($) divided by the standard quantity sold in kilograms.
3.	[Standard Median Price per kg]: Calculate the standard Price per kg ($/kg) median values at the Crop level – everything has been converted to kilograms so distinct crop units are comparable – at different geographic locations (e.g., national, regional, county, sub-county, etc.)
4.	We assign these standard prices per kg median values to each crop that was harvested but not sold to compute the value of the crop harvested by merging the median price per kg at the crop level with at least 9 observations available for each geographic location using the most disaggregated location possible. 
5.	[Standard Quantity Harvested (kg)]: Convert every crop harvested in quantity units into kilograms (Quantity harvested kg) using the Standard Harvested Conversion factor table – which calculates the median conversion factor sold for at the crop-unit regional level using all Uganda waves available.
6.	[Standard Value Harvested {$)] We calculate the Standard Value Harvested using the standard quantity harvested (kg) and the standard median Price per kg ($/kg) [Value harvested = s.qty.harv*Priceperkg]
This section also includes crop plantation start date (month-year), crop harvest start and end date (month-year), total time of plantation, pure stand crops (monocropped vs intercropped), and permanent crops. The unit of analysis for this dataset is at the hh-plot-crop-season level.

It also estimates the value of lost harvested at the household level.
