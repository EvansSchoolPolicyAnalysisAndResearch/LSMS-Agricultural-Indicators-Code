### Harmonized DTAs

This folder will contain modified versions of the DTA files that contain unique identifiers for household, parcel, and field without requiring the higher-level variable to produce unique observations.

## Additional Files in This Directory: 
 * hhid_panel_key.dta: This is file produced by EPAR that harmonizes household IDs for easier panel merges. It will replace the original household ids with the harmonized household ids in the dta files saved to this folder unless the harmonization code is commented out (some portions of the code may no longer work if this is done.
